# IS-Optics
My 2020 Independent Study on Light Optics in Computer Graphics. Using Unity, I accurately simulate light physics in real-time.

## Demo videos
You can see the results of this code in a [PowerPoint presentation here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!An73-S_0mmcmgft62yT6IRjp8ccjOQ?e=KON40P).

## How to open the project yourself
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Unity. This project used Unity 2018.x LTS, but it should be compatible with 2019.x LTS
3. Open the project in Unity, go to Assets/Scenes in the project explorer and pick a scene to checkout!

## Notes
* the user microBob and kyangEPS are both me, just different emails on different computers for when some simulations required more power
